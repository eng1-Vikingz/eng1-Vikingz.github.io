        <h2>Week 1</h2>
        <pre>
During week 1 we sat down and discussed the project as a whole. After 
coming up with a basic plan for the game we created a spreadsheet to 
equaly distribute the work. On Friday's meeting we all came together to
come up with a list of requirements and questions for our client in next
weeks interview. </pre>

        <h2>Week 2</h2>
        <pre>
During week 2 we finished off our interview questions and had our meeting 
with the client. Following this meeting we began work on our requirements.
On Friday's meeting we discussed the timeframe of the whole project and 
started to create an initial gantt chart (pictured bellow) outlining when 
important tasks would start and finish.</pre>

        <h2>Week 3</h2>
        <pre>
            During week three, after our very insightful meeting with the client, 
            we could finally start on creating the requirements for our game. 
            We tried to get down all of the requirements as soon as possible so 
            that we could start implementing our game. By the end of week 3 we also 
            finalised the overview of our project timeline gantt chart.

        <h2>Week 4</h2>
        <p>
            During week 4 we realised that we may have needed a bit more time 
            to finalise the requirements and so we kept developing them through 
            to the end of the week. During this week we also worked on the risk 
            assessment and began working on designing our games architecture.

        <h2>Week 5</h2>
        <p>During week 5 we started implementing the game. We started a little 
            later than we would have liked to, however we had to make sure that 
            we were concrete with our design ideas and initial architecture before
             we could start programming. During this week we also continued working
              on the architecture document, a bunch of team members developing the
               game, whilst the rest of the team would be designing the next steps 
               that had to be implemented. Whilst working on the coding, we also 
               started work on the assets of the game. We started to design both the
                background tiles and the building textures that would be used in the
                 game. We also started work on creating music and sound effects for
                 the game at around the same time.</p>

        <h2>Consolidation Week</h2>
        <p>By consolidation week we were applying finishing touches to our 
            architecture document which meant we were only left with coding 
            and assets design left to do. During this week the majority of the
             game was implemented. During the coding process we made sure that
              we were constantly referencing the architecture document and 
              evolving our design document to fit our requirements. We went 
              through a couple of iterations of the structural class diagram, 
              and finally settled on a configuration that worked well.</p>

        <h2>Week 6</h2>
        <p>During week 6 the majority of the game had been coded, the only thing 
            that was left now was to go through the game thoroughly and uncover
             any bugs that may have crept in. We did end up running into a window
              resizing issue, which meant that whenever we tried placing down buildings
               sometimes the mouse would be offset to the building texture on the 
               screen, but after a day of brainstorming we managed to fix it.</p>
